Comprehensive Report of the Tamagotchi App 


Introduction 

In this comprehensive report a thorough documentation was done in the process of crafting an innovative Android application geared towards enabling users to develop positive habits through the responsibilities of caring for their virtual pets. The mobile application design was inspired by the classical Tamagotchi virtual pet game that was popular during the 1990s, this version of the Tamagotchi game enables the user to nurture and care for their virtual pet by completing real-life tasks such as feeding, washing and playing with their virtual pet on their electronic device through the Tamagotchi application. The primary goal of this Tamagotchi app is to capture the nostalgia of the classical Tamagotchi pet game, motivate users to cultivate real-life responsibilities of caring for pets through the virtual window and assists users by carrying out positive habits that are said to be a coping mechanism. Throughout this report the methods used, the purpose , the objectives and the vision driving its creation will be discussed as report will unveil the transition of the virtual Tamagotchi game into its new innovative mobile version.


Methods

Positive Habits are adopted from this Tamagotchi app and maintained throughout it as it encourages users by associating them with nurturing their virtual pet. The responsibilities that come with the Tamagotchi app are gamified as the game-like elements are incorporated making habit formation and the responsibilities engaging and fun. Responsibility is fostered in users as they are prompted to care for their virtual pets which links their habits of caring for their virtual pets to the well-being of the pets. Unlike the classical Tamagotchi virtual game, this Tamagotchi application will provide users with feed back on their habits and progress over time which will allow them to adjust their behaviours accordingly to their virtual pets’ needs. 
During the development of this Tamagotchi application,  thorough considerations were taken into account where the application prioritises user engagement through striking colours and appealing visuals. A sense of ownership is stimulated as the Tamagotchi app enables users to set goal and habits tailored to their need and preferences. To reinforce positive behaviours and habits the application provides feedback to the users.


GitHub Utilization 

In the development and maintenance of the Tamagotchi app, GitHub is the primary version control for the Tamagotchi codebase which according to Julie (Juliver, 2024) allows multiple developers to collaborate on this project. According to (Juliver, 2024) the online software development platform GitHub also serves as a social networking site where developers can openly network and pitch their work in. With GitHub’s issue tracking feature it’ll enable developers to log, prioritize, facilitate communication and assign tasks. The tests, build and deployment process of the Tamagotchi App is automated by GitHub Actions as it is a continuous integration and continuous delivery(CI/CD) platform where the developers are able to create workflows that build and test every pull request to their repository or deploy merged pull and requests to production. GitHub Actions also ensures new code changes are thoroughly tested and seamlessly deployed. GitHub’s workflows are configurable automated processes that will run one to more jobs for the application. The workflows are defined by a YAML file checked in to the applications repository and will run when triggered by an event in its repository or triggered manually or even at a defined schedule. GitHub has the ability to foster a thriving community around this Tamagotchi application which will enable developers and users to contribute code, report issues and suggest improvements. 


Results

The outcome of this development isn’t just a game for users to occupy themselves with but an innovative product where modern technology was used to recreate an original classical piece into today's technical world. This new innovation not only keeps its users engaged but also enables them to implement nurturing habits into their daily routines.

Conclusion 
In conclusion the development of the Tamagotchi application was to gamify the classical version into the modern technological world, the mobile application is also designed to promote user’s positive behaviour and habits through the nurturing and caring for of their virtual pet by turning the responsibilities that come with the virtual pets into a game. This Tamagotchi application aims to empower youth at a young age and adults to lead healthier, more productive lives by incorporating principles of behavioural psychology, game-like designs and user experience. In addition, the use of GitHub and GitHub Actions have played a significant role in the development of the Tamagotchi virtual application, providing tools for version control and automation. By leveraging these platforms onto the Tamagotchi app, it enables developers to collaborate effectively and maintain the code quality.  Since the technology advanced the the classical Tamagotchi virtual game, GitHub and GitHub actions remain as essential tools for modern software development, empowering developers to robust and innovate applications efficiently.
